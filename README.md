--Check final version on a main branch--

Deployed by Firebase Hosting - https://angular-blog-fe85c.web.app

This large project includes a different range of tasks performed. The main functionality is blogging. Display a list of all posts with the ability to view them, like them, leave comments with a rating, edit comments, leave responses to comments. There is an opportunity to set a dark theme for the application. Also implemented ENG/UKR localization. The application has an admin panel with authorization and protection of the necessary Routes with the help of interceptor. In the admin panel itself you can create new posts, upload pictures, add translations for localization.  There is also a list of all posts with the ability to search by title, edit posts as well as delete them. Application interaction with the data is carried out with the help of the connected Firebase Realtime Database. Authentication is done using Firebase Authentication. As a result, we have a fully controlled, scalable application. 

It is difficult to describe the whole range of performed tasks, but from the most important I would like to note: 
-Working with REST API manipulating CRUD operations.
-Work with authentication, protection of routers using interceptor, getting and storing JWT-token
-Implemented application reactivity using RxJs
-Validation of all forms
-Error handling
